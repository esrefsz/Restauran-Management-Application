# Restauran-Management-Application

This project has been created using resources from the izleveogren YouTube channel.

To publish the project, it is recommended to transfer it to C:\ and then publish it (if the path is too long, some DLL files may not be accessible).

Inside the generated folder, you will find a setup.exe. Running it will install the program.

The project can work with a database named 'Restaurant.' You should import a '.bak' file into SQL Management Server.

In the location where the project is installed, you should add a file named 'sqlPath.txt' with the following content: 'Server=MYSERVERNAME;Database=Restaurant;Trusted_Connection=true.' Replace 'MYSERVERNAME' with the SQL server name in your computer where the program is running.

FOR CODERS:

Before publishing the project, modify the 'servername' in the app.config file with the server name on your computer where you intend to install it.
